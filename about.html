                        into the opponent's end zone.<br> This can be achieved by running with the ball, passing it to a
                        teammate, or kicking it through the goalposts.

                    <h1>History</h1>
                    <p>Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk
                        football” games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a
                        minimum of rules.<br> Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure
                        time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions<br>
                        against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the games
                        status from the early 19th century onward.<br>FIFA's mission, for example, is to "develop the
                        game, touch the world, build a better future," emphasizing global development and the sport's
                        positive influence. Individual organizations like India Khelo Football focus on talent
